    07. Theatre Promotion

A theatre is doing a ticket sale, but they need a program to calculate the price of a single ticket.
If the given age does not fit one of the categories, you should print "Error!".
You can see the prices in the table below:
Day / Age	    0 <= age <= 18	    18 < age <= 64	    64 < age <= 122
Weekday	            12$	                    18$	            12$
Weekend	            15$	                    20$	            15$
Holiday	            5$	                    12$	            10$

Input
The input comes in two lines. On the first line, you will receive the type of day.
On the second – the age of the person.

Output
Print the price of the ticket according to the table, or "Error!" if the age is not in the table.

Constraints
•	The age will be in the interval [-1000…1000].
•	The type of day will always be valid.
